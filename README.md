### Hello everyone, My name is Ansh Sharma. I am a first year CS student. I have always had a keen interest in Computers. I know how to program in Java, Python and I am learning C. I use a Macbook for coding and know the basic commands of the Terminal Window. I would like to get a better knowledge of Linux and Unix-like operating systems. I am currently working on a side project to get a better understanding of NNs and CNNs (in Machine Learning). I am a huge fan of Apple and would want to become an Apple Developer in the future.
