### Hello everyone, My name is Ansh Sharma. I am a fourth year CS student. I have always had a keen interest in Computers. I know how to program in Java, Python and C++. I would like to get a better knowledge of Linux and Unix-like operating systems. I am currently working on a side project to get a better understanding of NNs and CNNs. I wake up everyday trying to learn something new that day.
